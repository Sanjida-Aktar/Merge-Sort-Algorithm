## 🚀 How Merge Sort Works
Merge Sort is a **divide and conquer** algorithm.  
It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

**Steps:**
1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
